### IMPORTANT NOTE!!!
On the bottom side of the board you will see two separate solder jumper pins. These connect/disconnect the pull up resistors for your I2C lines. If somewhere else on your design you already have pull up resistors for your I2C lines, then you donÂ´t need to do anything, aka leave them unsoldered. If you need to use the pull up resistors, simply just solder the two pads together. One jumper is for the SCL line, and the other is for SDA. If you would like your boards to come with presoldered jumpers, please just let me know immediately after your order at aerostrikeex@gmail.com and I will solder it for you!!
# Other Future Versions
All are available for custom order, for specificed weight and size needs. Not normally stocked, and require a bit more lead time and cost to sell. If you are also the first customer buying these specific versions, I will have to design them, so please take into account 3-4 extra days max on the lead time: 
- BMI088 SPI & I2C Breakout 
- Super Lightweight Series BMI088 Breakout SPI (For When Every Gram Matters) 
- Super Lightweight Series BMI088 Breakout I2C (For When Every Gram Matters) 
- SMD Mounted BMI088 Breakout SPI (For When Every Millimeter Matters) 
- SMD Mounted BMI088 Breakout I2C (For When Every Millimeter Matters)   

If you have custom specifications, please contact me (aerostrikeex@gmail.com) for details. The design is easily configurable, so it will not cost 100s of dollars and weeks to redesign and order your custom boards! 
# Mass/Bulk Orders
If you would like to buy bulk orders of the breakout (more than what I have listed in stock on the AeroStrike Online Store, please contact me and I will set up cheaper shipping and costs for you, and see if I can find the supply of sensors available (The BMI088 is out of stock almost everywhere as of September 2021).
